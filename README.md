# DecentChat: A Decentralized Chat Application

Welcome to DecentChat, a decentralized chat application that allows you to form your own networks for communication. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and using the application.

## Getting Started

1. **Initialize the Network**: Start with two nodes to initialize the network. For instance, let's consider two friends, Kunj and Stan. As this is demonstrated on localhost, we are using two different ports. Here are the initial setups for Kunj and Stan.

2. **Set Next Nodes**: Next, Kunj and Stan need to set their next nodes. Here are the setups for Kunj and Stan repectively.

10. **Automatic Contact Addition**: As Stan is not added as a contact for Kunj, the application automatically adds him with the username as default. Here's how it looks:

14. **Request to Join the Network**: Instead of setting next-nodes, John requests Kunj to join the network. Here's how he does it: 

  ![Screenshot 2024-05-02 150717](https://github.com/kunjpatel1402/Chat-Application/assets/75675988/95f8e4f3-13b3-4667-bf19-29f489e0e7ce)

15. **Receiving Messages When Offline**: Now, what happens when a sender sends a message to an offline receiver and leaves the network? Let's find out (Stan saves the message for Kunj and he retrieves it when he comes back online). Close the window for Kunj. Send a message from Peter to Kunj (Notice new fingers and next-nodes for Peter after Kunj leaves the network). And close Peter. Here's how it looks:

16. **Reopening the Application**: Reopen Kunj's window and see that he has received Peter's message. Here's how it looks: 
    ![Screenshot 2024-05-02 150209](https://github.com/kunjpatel1402/Chat-Application/assets/75675988/c7cfc773-961e-4b39-a0a1-3b9474b9ea20)
 Use the Join method and request Stan to join the network. Here's how it looks:
